                <p>At Codebell, we're passionate about making it easy for people to stay connected with their assets. We
                    believe that everyone should be able to easily and quickly access their homes, vehicles, luggage,
                    and
                    other important belongings, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
                <p>Our innovative product, also called Codebell, allows you to do just that. By simply sticking a QR
                    code on
                    your asset, you can video call the owner without the need to exchange phone numbers or other
                    personal
                    information. Our goal is to provide a simple, secure, and efficient way to stay connected with your
                    belongings, so you can have peace of mind no matter where life takes you.

                </p>
